# Design and analyze current mirror circuit as active load in cs amplifier circuit

Before starting with the experiment we need to know what is necessity of replacing the resistive load with current mirror circuit as active load.
So let us perform the experiment with resistive load and analyze the circuit and then perform experiment on the current mirror circuit as active load.

The following experiment analyzes a Common-Source (CS) amplifier with a resistive load using LTspice simulation. The objective is to study its voltage gain, frequency response, output resistace, and power consumption. The results help in understanding the limitations of a resistive load and serve as a foundation for exploring active load alternatives.
